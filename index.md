Many supported Torben throughout his time in jail.
Torben got persecuted in Denmark (a small country in northern Europe),
and moved to the USA where the persecution continued.
We believe Torben got to be a hot potato in jail, because they would not have liked that he got raptured from jail, as a testemony for others.

We believe God sent the right people on the plane, to support Torben as he prepared to be reunited with his family.

The Lord can use a broken vessel, and He broke Torben in jail.
The Lord Instructed Gideon to Gather his troops on the hills above
the enemy. They were to have a lit torch covered by a clay-pot.
Then at nightfall up on the hill surrounding the enemy camp,
blow the horn, and in unison break the pot's so the flames were reviled.
The enemy got so frightened and confused, that they fought each other, and dispersed quickly, even though the Israelites were greatly outnumbered.

God puts His Holy Spirit in we earthly vessels, then breaks us, to reveal the light.
